JSON-RPC over WebSocket
=======================


This is an implementation of
`JSON-RPC 1.0<http://json-rpc.org/wiki/specification>`_
over `WebSockets<http://dev.w3.org/html5/websockets/>`_.

The server is implemented in Python, with the Eventlet
networking library.

The client is ECMAScript (JavaScript), and runs in the
latest browsers supporting WebSockets.


Project Status
--------------

The project is in an early **alpha** state.
I will use it in production soon, so expect rapid improvements.
